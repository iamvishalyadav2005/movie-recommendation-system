## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Cleaned and merged movie & rating datasets
   * Handled missing values

2. **Content-Based Filtering**

   * Used TF-IDF vectorization on genres
   * Applied cosine similarity to find similar movies

3. **Collaborative Filtering**

   * Built user-item matrix
   * Calculated similarity between movies using ratings

4. **Hybrid Model**

   * Combined:

     * Content similarity
     * Collaborative similarity
     * Popularity score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Frontend/UI:** Streamlit
* **API:** TMDB API (for posters)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
